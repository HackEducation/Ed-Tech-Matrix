## Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2013: The Business of Ed-Tech

As part of my year-end review of ed-tech trends, I tried to identify all the startups who've raised venture capital in 2013. (This data came from weekly news posts I've written.) For more information on "The Business of Ed-Tech" in 2013, [you can read the full article](http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/23/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-business/).

I created [a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApOobZWAkwW4dHdwRGFjSkNkTk92dHJPN2Z6d0RUR0E&usp=sharing) that contains the data, company name, investment amount, investor, and subcategory, as well as a link to the URL where news was published.
