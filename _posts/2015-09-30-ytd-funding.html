<p>I&#8217;ve just updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G5vM1m5KUy_Q6N4oiNyo9rEnjcYBVT4RB3eyjmE0ao/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> that I&#8217;ve created to track which startups have raised money (from which investors) this year. <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/09/30/sofi-raises-whopping-1-billion-to-refinance-student-loans/">As I was doing so, news broke that Social Finance, a student loan refinancing company, has raised $1 billion</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s not included in these calculations.</p>

<p>(JSON files with the data &#8211; for funding, acquisitions, and mergers &#8211; are available via GitHub. Previous updates &#8211; for <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/2015/04/03/ed-tech-funding-q12015/">Q1</a> and <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/2015/07/31/ytd-funding/">Q2</a> &#8211; are available via <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">matrix.hackeducation.com</a>.)</p>

<p>By my accounting, it appears as though funding has dropped off* (dramatically) in the last few months &#8211; in dollar figures and deal count:</p>

<ul>
<li>January: $358 million across 24 deals</li>
<li>February: $430 million across 25 deals</li>
<li>March : $118 million across 16 deals</li>
<li>April: $127 million across 19 deals</li>
<li>May: $179 million across 18 deals</li>
<li>June: $250 million across 21 deals</li>
<li>July: $132 million across 20 deals</li>
<li>August: $77 million across 10 deals</li>
<li>September: $55 million across 12 deals</li>
<li>(Total: $1.7 billion)</li>
</ul>

<p>* except that whole SoFi round, of course</p>


<p>I don&#8217;t want to read too much into the decline. Some of it is my bookkeeping, no doubt &#8211; September&#8217;s numbers don&#8217;t include anything from this week, for example, because I haven't written this week's news roundup. (Sorry. I suck.)</p>

<p>Some of the dip (if there <em>is</em> a dip) could be, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/fastest-raising-startups-in-ed-tech/">as investment analysis firm CB Insights noted earlier this month</a>, that ed-tech startups are taking longer to get to their Series A rounds. Some of it could be the result of the recent slowdown in the Chinese economy (there was <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/chinas-booming-ed-tech-industry/">heavy investment in Chinese ed-tech startups</a> during the first half of the year). </p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out too that some months&#8217; large dollar figures are skewed by a handful of record-setting Series B and beyond rounds.</p>

<p>The biggest ed-tech investments so far this year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Social Finance $200 million</li>
<li>Lynda.com $186 million</li>
<li>AltSchool $100 million</li>
<li>17zuoye $100 million</li>
<li>Udemy $65 million</li>
<li>Yuantiku $60 million</li>
<li>NetDragon Education $52.5 million</li>
<li>Genshuixue $50 million</li>
<li>Coursera $49.5 million</li>
<li>Duolingo $45 million</li>
<li>Orbotix $45 million</li>
<li>LittleBits $44.2 million</li>
<li>Instructure $40 million</li>
<li>BrightBytes $33 million</li>
</ol>

<p>Some trends here: &#8220;online learning&#8221; platforms that focus on &#8220;jobs skills&#8221;; learning-to-code via hardware; the privatization of student loans and elementary school. Beyond these big deals, other trends: tutoring, test prep, and "data." Stay innovative, ed-tech.</p>
