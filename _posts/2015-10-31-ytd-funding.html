<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G5vM1m5KUy_Q6N4oiNyo9rEnjcYBVT4RB3eyjmE0ao/edit?usp=sharing">Google Spreadsheet</a> where I&#8217;m tracking on this year&#8217;s startup investments, acquisitions, mergers, and IPOs. JSON files containing the data are <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">in this project&#8217;s repo on GitHub</a>. Previous updates &#8211; for <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/2015/04/03/ed-tech-funding-q12015/">Q1</a>, <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/2015/07/31/ytd-funding/">Q2</a>, and <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/2015/09/30/ytd-funding/">Q3</a> &#8211; are available via <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">matrix.hackeducation.com</a>.</p>

<p>This month &#8211; well, the end of September too &#8211; saw some pretty sizable investments, so here&#8217;s the updated list of the biggest funding rounds so far this year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Social Finance $1,200,000,000</li>
<li>Lynda.com $186,000,000</li>
<li>Hujang.com $157,000,000</li>
<li>17zuoye $100,000,000</li>
<li>AltSchool $100,000,000</li>
<li>Civitas Learning $76,000,000</li>
<li>General Assembly $70,000,000</li>
<li>Udemy $65,000,000</li>
<li>Coursera $61,100,000</li>
<li>Yuantiku $60,000,000</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-10-Ed-Tech-Companies-That/233979">The Chronicle of Higher Education published a story this week</a> listing the higher ed companies which have received the most funding. I think their story was flawed &#8211; it included 2U, for example, but as it IPO&#8217;d last year, I&#8217;m not clear why it was on the list. Here&#8217;s my guess at the startups &#8211; and this includes those who sell to K&#8211;12 not just to universities &#8211; that have raised the most investment (and that have not been acquired or filed for IPO):</p>

<ol>
<li>Social Finance $1,598,000,000</li>
<li>Hujang.com $187,000,000 *</li>
<li>D2L $165,000,000</li>
<li>Pluralsight $162,500,000</li>
<li>Coursera $146,100,000</li>
<li>17zuoye $135,000,000</li>
<li>AltSchool $133,000,000</li>
<li>Open English $120,250,000</li>
<li>General Assembly $119,500,000</li>
<li>Kaltura $116,100,000</li>
</ol>

<p>* This is a guess at the total raised. <a href="http://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2015/10/29/hina-group-joins-157m-series-d-round-in-hujiang-com">According to the news report</a>, it plans to file for an IPO soon, so perhaps it's ineligible for my list anyway.</p>
