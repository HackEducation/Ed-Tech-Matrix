<p>I am going to try to do a better job of tracking on ed-tech startup funding this year. (I had to scramble when writing my &#8220;<a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">Business of Ed-Tech</a>&#8221; post in December as I didn&#8217;t have a list of the top funding rounds, for example.</p>

<p>My goals: track investment and make the data open and machine-readable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13G5vM1m5KUy_Q6N4oiNyo9rEnjcYBVT4RB3eyjmE0ao/edit?usp=sharing">Google Spreadsheet</a>, and each month I&#8217;ll export the data as a JSON file here. (So heads-up if you fork that particular file.)</p>
