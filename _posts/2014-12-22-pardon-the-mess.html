<p>I'm spending the holidays updating all my sites. It isn't simply a matter of a new template or a new look. I'm moving everything out of my current CMS and onto Jekyll. My apologies if things are broken, particularly when it comes to the RSS feed. Send me an email if you find specific problems. Or better yet, since this is all on Github, <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/">file an issue</a>.</p>
