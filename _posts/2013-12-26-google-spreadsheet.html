<p>As part of my year-end review of ed-tech trends, I tried to identify all the startups who've raised venture capital in 2013. (This data came from weekly news posts I've written.) For more information on "<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/23/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-business/">The Business of Ed-Tech" in 2013</a>, you can read the full article.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApOobZWAkwW4dHdwRGFjSkNkTk92dHJPN2Z6d0RUR0E&usp=sharing">a Google spreadsheet</a> that contains the data, company name, investment amount, investor, and subcategory, as well as a link to the URL where news was published.</p>
