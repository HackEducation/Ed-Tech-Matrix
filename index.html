<p>Who's investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between politics and policies? Between dollars and trends? Who's funding teacher-founded startups? Who's funding women and minority-led startups? What does the "map" of the ed-tech industry look like? What are the relationships between companies, entrepreneurs, investors, and institutions?</p>

<p>It's my hope to build better "maps" of the ed-tech industry in the hopes that we we can more easily navigate it. To that end, I have started work on an open database of education startup funding. This database (like this site) is <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">hosted on GitHub</a> so that people can contribute and fork.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> as of 2016, this site will no longer be updated. The latest version of this project is available at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>.</p>
