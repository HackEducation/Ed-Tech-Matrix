<h2>The Ed-Tech (Industry) Matrix</h2>     
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/network150.png" align="right" style="margin:15px">Who’s investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between politics and policies? Between dollars and trends? What does the “map” of the ed-tech industry look like? What are the relationships between companies, entrepreneurs, investors, and institutions?</p>

<p>I would like to build better “maps” of the ed-tech industry in the hopes that we we can more easily navigate it. To that end, I have started work on an open database of education startup funding. This database (like this site) is <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">hosted on GitHub</a> so that people can contribute and fork.</p>

<p>Via the GitHub interface, you can ask questions that will help shape the research (and shape the data I collect). To do so, <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix/issues/new">submit an &#8220;issue.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Clearly, this project is under development. In the meantime, you can read some of the other posts I&#8217;ve written on Hack Education about startup funding:</p>
