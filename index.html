<h2>The Ed-Tech (Industry) Matrix</h2>
<br />       
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/network150.png" align="right" style="margin:15px">Who’s investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between politics and policies? What does the “map” of the ed-tech industry look like? What are the relationships between companies, entrepreneurs, investors, and institutions?</p>
<br />
<p>I would like to build better &#8220;maps&#8221; of the ed-tech industry in the hopes that we we can more easily navigate it. I&#8217;d like to create an open database of education startup funding, for starters, and host it on GitHub so that people can contribute and fork.</p>
<br />
<p>So clearly, this section of Hack Education is under development. In the meantime:</p>

<br />
<p>And yes, I&#8217;m calling it a &#8220;matrix&#8221; and not an &#8220;ecosystem.&#8221; The latter &#8211; a popular term in the tech realm, I realize &#8211; connotes a natural, symbiotic, and ideally sustainable system. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s what we have here in education... And that's partially why I think we should make maps so we can better tell where the heck we might be headed.</p>
