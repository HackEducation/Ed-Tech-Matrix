<p>Who's investing in education technology? What are the relationships between investors and startups? Between politics and policies? Between dollars and trends? Who's funding teacher-founded startups? Who's funding women and minority-led startups? What does the "map" of the ed-tech industry look like? What are the relationships between companies, entrepreneurs, investors, and institutions?</p>

<p>I would like to build better "maps" of the ed-tech industry in the hopes that we we can more easily navigate it. To that end, I have started work on an open database of education startup funding. This database (like this site) is <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix">hosted on GitHub</a> so that people can contribute and fork.</p>

<p>Via the GitHub interface, you can ask questions that will help shape the research (and shape the data I collect). To do so, <a href="https://github.com/HackEducation/Ed-Tech-Matrix/issues/new">submit an &#8220;issue.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>This project is under development. <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com/blog/">You can find updates here</a>. In the meantime, you can read some of the other posts I&#8217;ve written on Hack Education about startup funding:</p>
